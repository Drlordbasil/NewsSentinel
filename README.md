## Description
The News Aggregator and Sentiment Analysis project is a Python program that aggregates news articles from various online sources, performs sentiment analysis on the articles, and provides users with summaries and sentiment scores for each article. The program utilizes libraries like BeautifulSoup and Google's Python APIs to collect and analyze the data. With this program, users can stay informed about current events, access summarized information, and understand the sentiment surrounding various news topics.

## Project Features
1. **Web Scraping for Data Collection**: The program utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to scrape news articles from popular news websites and blogs. It extracts relevant information such as article titles, authors, publication dates, and content.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The program utilizes natural language processing libraries like NLTK or TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of each news article. Techniques like polarity analysis are applied to determine whether the sentiment expressed in the article is positive, negative, or neutral.

3. **Summarization**: The program uses algorithms like TextRank or Gensim's summarization module to generate concise summaries of each news article. It condenses the key points of the article into a shorter format.

4. **User Interface**: The program provides a web-based user interface where users can search for specific topics or keywords, view a list of relevant news articles, and access summaries and sentiment scores for each article. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly.

5. **Personalization**: The program incorporates a feature that allows users to provide feedback on the sentiment analysis results. As users interact with the program, it learns their preferences and refines the sentiment analysis algorithm accordingly.

6. **Trend Analysis**: The program utilizes tools like Google Trends or social media APIs to identify trending topics and determine their impact on news sentiment. It provides insights into how events or trends affect public opinion.

7. **Email Notifications**: The program offers the option for users to subscribe to specific topics or keywords and receive email notifications whenever new articles are published on those subjects.

8. **Data Visualization**: The program uses libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to create visualizations that summarize the sentiment trends over time or compare sentiment across different news sources.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-aggregator.git`
2. Change directory to the project folder: `cd news-aggregator`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Open the `config.py` file and configure the news sources you want to scrape. Add the URLs of the news websites or blogs to the `SOURCES` list variable.
2. Run the program: `python main.py`
3. The program will scrape news articles from the configured sources, perform sentiment analysis, generate summaries, and display the articles with sentiment scores and summaries.
4. Optionally, you can provide an email and topic to receive email notifications of news articles on specific topics.
